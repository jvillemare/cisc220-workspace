		 * is less than the value of the greatest child, it swaps with the
		 * greatest child and the index becomes that of the greatest of the
		 * two children. It continues until either it can’t bubble down any
		 * further or until neither child is greater than the parent (the
		 * value at the index */

		 * and calls deleteHeap2() method that many times, in essence deleting
		 * all the values from the heap. The only gotcha in this one is that
		 * deleteHeap2() modifies the heaplen property, so you will need a
		 * temporary variable in this method that gets set to the heaplen before
		 * the loop and then resets heaplen to that value after the loop.
		 * Otherwise the heaplen value will be changing as you are looping and
		 * it gets a bit crazy */
